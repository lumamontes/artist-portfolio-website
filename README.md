### Artist Portfolio Website

This is a simple artist portfolio website built with Next.js, Prismic and Tailwind. It fetches data from a Prismic CMS and uses static site generation to display pages. It features a portfolio page with a gallery of images, an about page, and a contact page that uses a form from Web3Forms.

This website was based on the starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).
